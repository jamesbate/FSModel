Linear coefficient of the heat capacity

This property can be found from the masses.
This assumes the Fermi surfaces are perfectly 2D and is rough.
Alternatively it is the density of states,
meaning inverse velocity and Fermi surface area.

2D case (mJ/mol/K^2):
Band 1: 0.78772
-------
 = 0.78772

General case (mJ/mol/K^2):
Band 1: 0.78772
-------
 = 0.78772
