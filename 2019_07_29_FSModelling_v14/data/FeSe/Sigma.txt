At polar angle 76.00 and azumithal 65.00, field 10.0.
The *leading order in B* sigma tensor is in (mu Ohm cm)^-1:

 4.176e+01  1.385e+03  1.264e+01

 1.385e+03  4.127e+01  8.139e+00

 1.264e+01  8.139e+00  9.252e-02

The resulting Hall coefficient would be:
3.323e-01 cm^3/C

Reminder that this is in lowest order of omega_c tau.
And that diagonal is B-independent, off is proportional.
