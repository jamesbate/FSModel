This is a list of issues:
- First unresolved in the current version
- Then resolved issues.
The idea is to swallow my pride and hope this will force me or someone else to fix them.
Please never use old versions or at least make sure to read this list.


29/07/2019 | v1.4
There is two classes of topology and angle combinations that do not work. 
1) The first is when the orbit where the Fermis surface ends
is not a point, this happens at B//z for a torus. 
This breaks the topology initial path algorithm.
Algorithmic problem with detection of Nodes.
Suggestion: Move the field a few degrees off.
2) The second is when field is in plane for a sphere, when 
you have the poles of the parametrization exactly halfway between
the nodes and force orbits to go exactly through them. 
This is actually a bug in a special way.
The expected behaviour is a crash, the observed behaviour
is that a half-completed orbit is returned.
If you ever try to compute the area of such an orbit
(which happens for both sigma and frequencies)
then it does properly crash as 'orbit is not closed'.
Suggestion: Move the field a few degrees off.

04/07/2019 | v1.3
Minor nuisance, it was found out that toruses cannot be covered 
fully by running the first parametrization argument over 2pi,
either near 0 or 90 degrees polar this will run along an orbit
instead of over all of them. There was a bandaid fix for this
specific case made in Geometry > CoverageSections > CoverageEndpoints,
which recognizes the case and allows the program to run over (2pi,2pi)
instead of (2pi,0) in (a,b) space. 
So this is fixed, but not to my taste.
Update 25/07/2019: Not fixed and harder than it might seem.
Update 29/07/2019: Fixed with even more mathematical rigour xD

>> Resolved 25/07/2019 for v1.4
There is a bug right now that seems to allow the area uncertainty to become
so low that non-extremal orbits that due to precision make a local extremum
are allowed in. Use your brain to see which is better, I sadly have no time 
to fix it right now with a tolerance level.
Solution: It was found that ExtremizeEvaluateNonLinear can walk over 
such a path that numerical precision effectively makes it walk 
backwards. This causes a fake maximum or minimum to be flagged and
once flagged, it will be 'optimized' but not discarded afterwards.
This is resolved by finishing the function with a sort on distance.



01/07/2019 | v1.1 & v1.2 !!!
>> Resolved for v1.3 on 01/07/2019
AreaImplementation has to sum area vectors from the cross product 
and only do the norm once at the end. This has no effect in 
'simple' cases, but can quadruple the area at high angles in 
corrugated cilinders, where backtracking when triangulating is highly relevant.




30/06/2019 | v1.3
>> Resolved 03/07/2019
- Geometry torus with direction polar=0 returns no sections at all
- Geometry torus with direction elsewhere finds one out of two 'topology=-1' areas

This is right after the topology finally works robustly for all sorts of 
difficult shapes and various bugs with the trivial cases were solved
one by one afterwards (no nodes, poles along direction, paths aligned with a/b).
This seems initially as if it requires the negative 
topology to instead reflect the difference between the starting
and final point rounded to 2pi multiples, which changes a bunch of stuff.
It is doable, but the Coverage functions are just now working and I am going to bed.
(yes, it is 2 am).

Fix:
1/7 it turned out the volume was not correctly predicted when 
using high angles. This was fixed on 2/7 and finetuned on 3/7
and a side-effect of the fix is that Torus now also works.
Exception is polar=0 for which there are nodal lines,
which is now raising an error as this cannot be resolved.
